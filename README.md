# Security Devroom @ FOSDEM'15

[FOSDEM 2015](https://fosdem.org/2015/) had, once again, a security devroom, this time on the topic of _"Hardware and Software isolation mechanisms"_. 

The security devroom was held on **Sunday 1st of February 2015** in Brussels, Belgium at [ULB](http://www.ulb.ac.be/) room S.AW1.120 **from 09:00 to 17:00**.

## Our topic this year

As complex software tends to have bugs, methods to contain the damage from a
potentially serious bug (e.g., code injection, leak of memory contents) are 
required. While such methods have been known and available for a long time (HSMs and
smart cards, privilege separation), it is surprising that an attack like
_heartbleed_ required the revocation of the private keys of a large part of the
Internet. For that reason Hardware and Software isolation mechanisms that could
mitigate such attacks, are again on the line, and the main theme of this devroom.
