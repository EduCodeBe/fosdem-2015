FOSDEM 2015 Security Devroom organization and information
=========================================================
This year, FOSDEM will have a security devroom on the topic of "Hardware
and Software isolation mechanisms". We'd like to invite submissions of talks
and presentations, from security researchers and interested representatives 
of open source and free software. 

The security devroom will be held the _Sunday 1st of February 2015_ in Brussels,
Belgium.

Description of our topic
========================
As complex software tends to have bugs, methods to contain the damage from a
potentially serious bug (e.g., code injection, leak of memory contents) are 
required. While such methods have been known and available for long time (HSMs,
smart cards, privilege separation), it is surprising that an attack like
'heartbleed' required the revocation of the private keys of a large part of the
Internet. For that reason Hardware and Software isolation mechanisms, that could
contain such attacks, are again on the line, and the main theme of this devroom. 

Submission
==========
Submissions require a small abstract and short speaker presentation
and should be submitted via the https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM15
(you'll need to create an account, if you don't already have one from previous
years) before the 10th of December 2014. You can apply for a 25 min (20 min
presentation, 5 mins questions) slot.
