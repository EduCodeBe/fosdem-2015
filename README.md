# Security Devroom @ FOSDEM'15

Next [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2015/) will, again, have a security devroom, this time on the topic of _"Hardware and Software isolation mechanisms"_. We'd like to invite submissions of talks and presentations from developers, security researchers and other interested representatives of open source and free software projects.

The security devroom will be held on **Sunday 1st of February 2015** in Brussels, Belgium, room S.AW1.120 from 09:00 to 17:00

## Our topic this year

As complex software tends to have bugs, methods to contain the damage from a
potentially serious bug (e.g., code injection, leak of memory contents) are 
required. While such methods have been known and available for a long time (HSMs and
smart cards, privilege separation), it is surprising that an attack like
_heartbleed_ required the revocation of the private keys of a large part of the
Internet. For that reason Hardware and Software isolation mechanisms that could
mitigate such attacks, are again on the line, and the main theme of this devroom. 

## Submissions

Submissions require a small abstract and short speaker description
and must be submitted via the [Pentabarf](https://penta.fosdem.org) system before December 10, 2014. You can apply for a 25 min (20 min presentation + 5 mins questions) slot.
